# Building a hobby website
Last update: 27 Mar 2019

## Motivation
I was motivated by the complexity of the website of [Aleph](http://aleph-labs.com/). Thus, I deciced to replicate it to see how far my current skills can reach.

## Phases
### Phase 1: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
I encountered some difficulties because I really don't like Bootstrap. Each time I used any of a Bootstrap's pre-defined class, it took me a while to figure out what styles were applied.
In the end, I chose to use some of Bootstrap's classes and overrode them with pure CSS styles in some cases.

I have to admit that the Bootstrap's grid is awesome. It helped me to lay out the website fast and was very useful for responsive design. Additionally, I also combined the grid system with media queries to add flexibility to the website. The Bootstrap's navigation bar and hamburger menu were good although they needed some pure CSS styles for completeness.

### Phase 2: JavaScript
This is the most difficult part in building the website because JavaScript is a programming language. I'm still learning JavaScript to add it to the project.
