# Building a hobby website
Last update: 7th April 2019


## Motivation
I was motivated by the complexity of the website of [Aleph](http://aleph-labs.com/). Thus, I deciced to replicate it to see how far my current skills will be able to reach.


## Technology/Tools
- HTML5, CSS3
- Bootstrap
- SASS
- FontAwesome


## Installation

### SASS
`npm install -g sass`

### Keeping track of changes between styles/sass and styles/css
`sass --watch sass:css`
